# Questions (and Answers) Meeting 11-23-2021

## Nicolas
* ### Will we know the camera (configuration) matrix in our usecase?
* Maybe. We might get those of the sample data.

## Flo
* ### Set of found features too small for most feature rejection methods. Is this the normal case or mby caused by simulation?
* Set the threshhould for feature detection to a lower value to receive more features.

## General Info:
Try different feature detectors. No restriction on which ones to chose from.
