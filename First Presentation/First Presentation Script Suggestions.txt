0) Introduction

- names
- supervisor Reuben Docea
- title
- Short explanation, why there are just 2 speaking (wisdom tooth removal beforehand at 11:30)
- Short introduction to structure of presentation


1) Introduction to Topic and Difficulties

- Basic purpose of our work: Research on feature detection and matching rejection methods to improve feature matching in endoscopic environment for SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for MIS (Minimally Invasive Surgery)→ Picture
- short explanation of features and matching of features for anyone that does not know yet
- Test different methods and evaluate on synthetic test data
- Usually feature detector algorithms are not really suited for the fleshy environment without much sharp edges in the human body
→ mby cite Chen et al. (mby just a part, mby just copy their wording):
"These feature-based SLAM systems tend to work well in rigid, well
lit scenes with large working distances, but can fail to track or generate
sufficient features for dense reconstructions in settings such
as colonoscopy. The paucity of distinguishing features, tissue homogeneity,
deforming surface, and highly variable specular appearance
of the lumen can cause inconsistencies in estimating camera pose
for systems such as ORB-SLAM, as not enough ORB features can be
reliably tracked"

2) First Ideas and Research

- we are using mainly python
- Started with ORB feature detector, looked into others later (explaination in 4)
- Research on matching rejection methods firstly on Optical Flow Methods and Extended Kalman Filters as suggested by our supervisor
- short explanation of both (just one sentence each, OF will be explained further in the OF section)
- not really successful as we could not find any (meaningful) examples of these methods being used in our context yet
- further research into some other methods → RANSAC
- some papers used neural networks to find matches, evaded feature detection entirely → not our task


3) Different implementations

RANSAC (should be held by Nicolas)
- used in many applications especially to determine movement between two images
- computes a mathematical model for subsets of the data and compares the rest to the results (multiple iterations, mby show formula for suitable number of iterations)
- output is model calculation for which most data points are valid (and these data points)
- problem: finding a suitable model for our usecase
- homography, essential/fundamental matrix -> different amount of data points (=> iterations), actual meaning of models
- problems in our case: scene is very close to the camera, pixel movement might not be a linear function (investigate further on that before), might not know calibration matrix of camera
- general problem: currently only small amount of features
- already implemented in opencv for the mentioned models -> easy to use
- current results (fundamental matrix and mby also homography until presentation)
- possible improvement e.g. by classifying areas in the scene which should move more or less uniformly und try RANSAC on each of these areas

OF (should be held by Boyang)
- detailed explanation of OF (what's important for our use case)
- findings, difficulties…


4) Other feature detectors (should be held by Nicolas)

- problem mentioned in the beginning → not enough features (and the ones we have are pretty bad)
- explanation of what has been done so far to test out others
- mentioning research on new method that detects blood vessel branching points as features → specifically made for our use case
